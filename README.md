# dashcam-Helper
Concatenates and optionally timelapses movie files. Ideal for review and sharing of dashcam security cam video.

## Known current limitations:
- Doesn't perform dependency checks, but dependency breaks should be minimal.
- Cannot take input or output directories (workaround: place script in folder with video files to process)
- Only looks for .MOV files (workaround: edit script to find other file types)
- The author of this script is not an ffmpeg expert nor a video editing expert, so improvements may be made to the ffmpeg commands.
